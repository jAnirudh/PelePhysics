The tests to evaluate transport are to be conducted as follows.

1.) Compile both the surfaceTests/TransEval and
    surfaceTests/TranEvalCombinedRxnMech cases. These cases make use
    of the CH4Pt_GASPHASE and CH4Pt reaction mechanisms
2.) Run the executables
3.) execute diff on the resulting pltfiles. There should be no
    differences in the pltfile results obtained from both reaction
    mechanisms
